# *** Profect Purpose: ***
# To learn Web3, blockchain, smart contracts, and crypto (ethereum) transactions

# *** Accounts ***
## Establish connection to Web3
## Get a Node
## Retreive account balance 
## Convert balance to eth from wei


# *** Read a smart contract ***
# Etherscan 
## Go to https://etherscan.io/address/{ YOUR_ADDRESS_0x0000000000 } to get the abi code
## Set the address
## Get a contract 
## Get the total supply
## Get the balance 
## Convert amounts to ether from wei 


# *** Write a smart contract ***
## conntect to MetaMask Wallet port:7545
## set web3 to ganache/metaMask connection 
## Set a default account to sign transactions - this account is unlocked with Ganache
## Create a greeter contract ABI
## Greeter contract address - convert to checksum address
## Initialize contract
## Read the default greeting
## Set a new greeting
## Wait for transaction to be mined
## Display the new greeting value


# *** Deploy a smart contract ***
## Set up web3 connection with Ganache
## Get abi from etherscan 
## get bytecode 
## # set pre-funded account as sender
## Instantiate and deploy contract
## Submit the transaction that deploys the contract
## Wait for the transaction to be mined, and get the transaction receipt
## Create the contract instance with the newly-deployed address
## Display the default greeting from the contract
## update the greeting
## Wait for transaction to be mined...
# Display the new greeting value


# *** Send Transaction ***
## Connect to web3 with ganache / metamask
## Set accounts and private keys 
## Set nonce, to, value, gas, gasPrice
## Sign transaction
## Hash transaction 


# *** Inspect Blocks ***
## Fill in your infura API key here
## Get latest block number
## Get latest block
## Get latest 10 blocks
## Get transaction from specific block
